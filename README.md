**Overview**

Music Sharing is a web application where users choose an album to showcase on their profile. Music Sharing uses the Spotify API to retrieve Albums and album information. Users choose their top three songs off the album and may give a short description as to why they have chosen the album for their profile.


Users may visit the Music Sharing community to view other users profiles. One may leave a like on a profile if they like another users album selection. Users may also check out the album using the Spotify link located on the profile.


Each profile features a unique set of colors depending on the most relevant colors of the album. One may choose to change their profile and album selection through the edit profile option.
